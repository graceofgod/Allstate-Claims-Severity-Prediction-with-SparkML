# Allstate Claims Severity Prediction with SparkML
A key challenge for the insurance industry is provide their customers suitable insurance packages for the risk they represent. Various statistical methods have been applied to predict the likelihood and cost of insurance claims based on the consideration of different risk factors. 
Allstate Corporation launched a challenge and provided data on Kaggle in order to improve prediction accuracy of claim severity. The competition “Allstate Claims Severity” on Kaggle already came to an end on December 2016. The goal of this project is to apply the Apache Spark ML on Allstate data for building regression models. 
The challenges of the Allstate dataset are (1) a weak relation between claim severity and input predictors and (2) high dimensionality (3) big data. In this project, I implement features engineering as well as a Logistic Regression model to predict the loss of insurance claims.
